# Notes on Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences

### Description:

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my article, which revisits and modernizes the mathematical demonstrations found in Galileo Galilei’s *Dialogues on the Two New Sciences*. The goal is to express Galileo’s theorems using modern notation and mathematical language, making his ideas more accessible to contemporary readers.

### Project Structure:

You will see the final result of the whole article in [main.pdf](src/build/main.tsx).

If you want to see the LaTeX code of the article, you can see it in the [main.tex](src/main.tex).
